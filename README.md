# Battleships

Welcome to Battleships!!!

A classic two-player game where players take turns guessing the location of the other player's ships on a grid. The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

## Deployment

To deploy this project you will need to:

-   Set up the backend on AWS. Lambda function found [here](https://github.com/adamtommo/battleships-lambda).
-   Add the WS_URL to the game.tsx file.
-   Host this frontend (I've used [GitHub Pages](https://blog.logrocket.com/deploying-react-apps-github-pages/#how-to-deploy-a-react-application-to-github-pages)).
